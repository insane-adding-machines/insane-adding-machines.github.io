<a id="embedded-freedom" class="anchor" href="#embedded-freedom" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Embedded Freedom</h3>

<p>In a world with an increasing amount of Embedded Systems, we promote Freedom for all the devices. While the majority of large and powerful systems (Smart phones, Home Gateways, Raspberry Pi's and similar) are already running Free Software, the embedded market mostly relies on system software that is written by hardware manufacturer and distributed under non-free license terms.</p>

<p>The vast majority of Operating Systems for the embedded world look very different from modern UNIX-like systems, and their APIs are not in line with the POSIX standards.</p>

<p>We want to change the state of the art of embedded systems by promoting Free Software and standard APIs at system level. No matter how small or short in resources, a system is a system and must behave as such.</p>

<h3>
<a id="protect-the-core" class="anchor" href="#protect-the-core" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Protect the core</h3>

<p>Kernel code is very important for the safety and the stability of a POSIX system. Multi-threading is made possible on small micro-controllers today, but there is still a long way to define the correct paradigms. Separating the application logic from the system control at CPU level is one of the most important steps to make your embedded system safe, reliable and robust. We promote a strong separation between applications and system code.</p>

<p>Just because you are coding embedded applications, it does not mean that you need to learn a new API, new tools, or have to fight with complex SDKs or struggle to find the documentation of that obscure system call.</p>

<p>POSIX already defines a standard for system and libraries calls, and there is no reason why you should change that when writing embedded applications.</p>

<p>Port your application code easily with a set of libraries having the same interface as the standard libC you are used to.</p>
